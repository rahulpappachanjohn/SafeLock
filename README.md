# SafeLock
**Circular Number Lock System (SwiftUI)**
This project implements a custom Circular Number Lock System using SwiftUI. It features a unique circular dial with 100 indicators (0-99) and a draggable mechanism where the user can rotate the circle to align numbers with a target indicator. The system simulates a traditional combination lock but with a visually appealing circular design.

**Key Features:**
**Circular Interface:** The number lock system is displayed in a circular format with indicators around the circumference.
\n**Interactive Rotation:** Users can rotate the dial to select a number, with real-time feedback on the currently selected number.
\n**Password Check:** Includes a visual password feedback system where the user must match the correct combination by aligning numbers with the target.
\n**SwiftUI Implementation:** Built entirely using SwiftUI, with smooth gesture-based interactions and animations.
This project can be used as a foundation for implementing custom lock mechanisms, puzzle games, or any interface requiring rotational number selection.
